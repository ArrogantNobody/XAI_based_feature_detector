In this project, we proposed a novel algorithm using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) \cite{BARREDOARRIETA202082} approach to achieve feature detection for ultrasound images based on Deep Unfolding Super-resolution network (USRNET). According to the results of experiments, our method showed higher interpret-ability and robustness than existing traditional feature extraction and matching algorithms. This method provides a brand new insight for medical image processing, and may achieve better performance in the future with the advance of deep neural network.
